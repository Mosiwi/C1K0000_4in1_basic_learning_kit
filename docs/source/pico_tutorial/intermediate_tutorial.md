# Pico_intermediate_tutorial      
----------------------------
This tutorial is based on the [C1K0001 4in1 basic learning kit](../Overview/Overview.md).     

Learn common programming syntax based on "Pico board + expansion board + peripheral module", and learn the most comprehensive MicroPython syntax and application with the lowest cost.     

## What is MicroPython?  
-----------------------      
MicroPython is a full implementation of the Python 3 programming language that runs directly on embedded hardware like Raspberry Pi Pico. You get an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute commands immediately via USB Serial, and a built-in filesystem. The Pico port of MicroPython includes modules for accessing low-level chip-specific hardware.      
1. The [MicroPython Wiki](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/wiki)
2. The [MicroPython Forums](https://forum.micropython.org/)
3. MicroPython is a language derived from Python, so it is recommended to learn [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html) first.

## Basic_chapter Blink     
----------------------               
**Objective:**     
1. Open the example code.     
2. Upload and run code.   
3. Verify that the pico motherboard works.      

**Demonstration:**       
Open the "**blink\.py**" file as follows:     
![Img](../_static/pico_tutorial/intermediate_img/3img.png)    

Run the code online: (The code is not saved in pico and is not executed after repowering.)       
Make sure your Raspberry PI Pico's USB is plugged into your computer's USB via a usb cable, then click on "Python" and the version number in the bottom right corner of the Thonny window, then select **"MicroPython(Raspberry PI Pico). COMx"**.      
![Img](../_static/pico_tutorial/intermediate_img/4img.png)    

After running the code, the LED on the pico board lights up every 1 second:      
![Img](../_static/pico_tutorial/intermediate_img/5img.png)    

Run the code offline: (The code is stored in pico, and the code in pico is automatically executed after being powered on.)     
Enter the code in the main panel, then click on the "**Save**" or "**File->Save as ...**" menu. Thonny will present you with a popup, click on "**Raspberry Pi Pico**" and enter "**main\.py**" to save the code to the **Raspberry Pi Pico**.

![Img](../_static/pico_tutorial/intermediate_img/8img.png)    

```{note}  
If you "save a file to the device" and give it the special name **main.py**, then MicroPython starts running that script as soon as power is supplied to Raspberry Pi Pico in the future.

Plug-in LED:    
Leds are also known as light-emitting diodes. It has positive and negative poles, generally the shorter pin or the pin near the gap is the negative pole, and the other end is the positive pole. Only when the forward current is connected, the LED light will be lit. Its current is generally required to be about 5-15ma, so resistors are often used in series with leds to achieve current limiting.      
![Img](../_static/pico_tutorial/intermediate_img/36img.png)    

SMD LED:      
![Img](../_static/pico_tutorial/intermediate_img/52img.png)

**Example code phenomena:**         
1. Search the 1-Wire bus for a connected device.           
2. Select the first device and verify the series number with CRC8.    
3. Write data to memory.         
4. Read data from memory

**FQA:**   
(1) EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)         
It is a kind of memory chip that does not lose data after power failure.

(2) 1-Wire protocol
1-Wire technology is a serial protocol that uses one data wire and one ground wire to communicate. The 1-Wire master can initialize and control one or more 1-Wire slaves on the 1-Wire. Each 1-Wire slave device has a unique, immutable, factory programmed 64-bit ID as the device address on the 1-Wire. Eight bits of the 64-bit ID are family codes that identify the device type and function. Generally, the operating voltage range of the 1-Wire slave machine is 2.8V (min) to 5.25V (max). Most 1-Wire devices are not pin-powered and they harvest energy from 1-wire (parasitic power supply).

-----------------   
**Objective:**     
1. What is uart?             

**Pins to be used:**   
1. TX: GP0    
2. RX: GP1     

**Wiring diagram:**        
![Img](../_static/pico_tutorial/intermediate_img/25img.png)    
Connect these two pins through a jumper wire or a metal wire.    

```{note}  
This wiring is equivalent to Pico's RX pin sending data to Pico's TX pin.    
```             

**Open the example code: "uart\.py"**     
1. Open the example code using the methods in **"[Basic_chapter](#basic-chapter-blink)"**.     
2. Run the example code online. 

**Example code phenomena:**         
Pico's serial port TX pin keeps sending data to Pico's RX pin, and the terminal prints the data received by the RX pin: **"Mosiwi!"**
